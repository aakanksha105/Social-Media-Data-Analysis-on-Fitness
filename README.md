# 📊 Social Media Data Analysis on Fitness

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end data analytics pipeline to analyze fitness-related discussions from social media platforms. It focuses on extracting trends, engagement patterns, and topic-level insights from large-scale unstructured text data.

The project was developed and executed on a **professor-assigned Virtual Machine (VM)**, simulating a real-world remote data processing environment and ensuring reproducibility across all project phases.
